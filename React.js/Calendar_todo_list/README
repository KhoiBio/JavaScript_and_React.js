Calendar To-Do App (React)

A simple calendar-based to-do app built with React, allowing you to:

Navigate months

Click a day to view/add/delete tasks

Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox

Persist tasks using localStorage

This app is portfolio-ready and fully responsive for basic desktop usage.

Features

Calendar with month navigation

Add / Delete / Complete tasks

Pending tasks bold on the calendar

Tasks persist even after refreshing the page

Component-based React code for easy maintenance

Option 1: Local Setup (Using Create React App)
1. Install Node.js

Download from nodejs.org
 and install it.
Check installation:

node -v
npm -v

2. Create a new React project
npx create-react-app calendar-todo
cd calendar-todo

3. Replace App.js and App.css

Open the project in a code editor (VS Code recommended)

Replace the content of src/App.js with the React code provided

Replace src/App.css with the CSS code provided

4. Start the development server
npm start


This opens the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

You’re ready to click on days, add/delete to-dos, mark completed tasks, and navigate months.

Option 2: Run Online (No Install)

You can try React instantly in the browser using CodeSandbox or StackBlitz:

Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/new
 → choose React

Replace App.js and App.css with the code provided

The app will automatically compile and run in the preview pane

Notes

LocalStorage works, so tasks persist across page reloads

Changes to the code hot-reload automatically in development mode

To build the app for production:

npm run build


This generates a production-ready version in the build/ folder.
